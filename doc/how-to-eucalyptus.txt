How to get Bluesky to work with Eucalyptus
------------------------------------------

Rich Wolski, November 2015

Eucalyptus is API compatible with AWS.  To get Bluesky to work with
Eucalyptus is a matter of setting the environment variables necessary to
get it to contact the Eucalyptus object store (called Walrus).

First, the version of Eucalyptus must be >= 4.0.  Bluesky uses libs3 which, in 
turn, uses easy_curl and easy_curl implements "Expect: 100-continue" two-part
messaging protocol on some PUT operations.  Prior versions of Eucalyptus send
back a "200 OK" message on these PUTs which easy_curl rejects.

You can use the community-supported version of libs3 (available from
https://github.com/bji/libs3.git) if Eucalyptus is configured to use
DNS names for its services.  If not, then you *must* use the forked
version if libs3 that comes with UCSBluesky so that you can use dotted
notation with a service path.

To get Bluesky to contact the Walrus endpoint, add 

export S3_HOSTNAME='walrus.<cloud domain>:8773'

where <cloud domain> is the DNS domain that has been allocated for the
Eucalyptus cloud.  For example, if "cloud.cs.ucsb.edu" were set up to refer
to a specific Eucalyptus cloud, then the bash format assignment would be

export S3_HOSTNAME='walrus.cloud.cs.ucsb.edu:8773'

If DNS is not configured for Eucalyptus, it is possible to use dotted 
notation for Walrus as well, however you must also specify a service path

export S3_HOSTNAME='192.168.1.1:8773'
export S3_SERVICEPATH="services/Walrus"

Bluesky also assumes that it will be storing its log entries in an S3
bucket that has already been created.  The default bucket name
is "Bluesky".  To set a different bucket name, set the environment variable

export BLUESKY_TARGET="s3:<bucketname>"

This bucket will need to exist before Bluesky will function 
(it doesn't test for it and then create it if it isn't there).

The easiest method for creating this base bucket is to use s3cmd.  There is
a version of it that HP maintains available at

https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/wiki/HowTo-use-s3cmd-with-Eucalyptus

After modifying s3cfg with the Eucalyptus parameters, run

s3cmd -c s3cfg mb s3://<bucketname>

For example,

s3cmd -c s3cfg mb s3://UCSBluesky

and then set the BLUESKY_TARGET to

export BLUESKY_TARGET="s3:UCSBluesky"

will create the bucket and then set the environment variable that configures
the proxy to use this bucket.

The Eucalyptus credentials must be available as environment variables 
(e.g. the eucarc file must be sourced in the shell) when nfsproxy starts.
