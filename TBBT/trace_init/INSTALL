System Requirements:

	- You must have PERL 5 (5.005 or later) installed in order to
		use any of these tools.  (None of these tools have
		been tested with PERL 6 or later.)

	- If you plan to use ns_quickview, make sure that gnuplot is
		installed on your system.
		
		ns_quickview has been tested with gnuplot 3.7 and
		should work with later versions.  If you have problems
		with ns_quickview, please include any diagnostics
		messages from gnuplot and the version of gnuplot with
		your bug report.

		If gnuplot is not in your path, you must edit
		ns_quickview to set GNUPLOT_PATH to the appropriate
		path after step 2 in the installation instructions.

Installation:

1.  Un-tar the distribution into an empty directory.

2.  Edit the first line of nfsscan and ns_* to point to wherever your
	favorite version of PERL 5 is installed.  If you don't like
	looking at debugging messages, remove the -w from the
	invocation of PERL.

3.  Make sure that nfsscan and ns_* are executable and that
	all the files are publically readable:

		chmod 444 *
		chmod 555 nfsscan ns_*

4.  Read NOTES.TXT for last-minute info or errata for this release,
	and changes from previous releases.

5.  Read nfsscan.txt and EXAMPLES for more information about how to
	use the tools.
