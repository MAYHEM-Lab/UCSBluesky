NFSSCAN BUGS

Known bugs for version 0.10a:

- Debugging messages and warnings may appear on stderr.  Most of these
	are meaningless, but if you encounter a problem with any of
	the programs program please include them in your bug report.

	Remove the -w from the invocation of PERL (on the first line
	of each script) if you want to get rid of the PERL warnings.
