# Usage: fragment_collect dev mount_dir test_path output_file
#
# On linux system, this script collects the fragmentation status of a 
# particular directory. The objects under this directory SHOULD NOT be 
# used as mount point. If they do, please umount them first, but there
# is no danger even if you forget. The "output_file" is the one that I
# need, please gzip it and send it back to nzhu@cs.sunysb.edu
#
# The program needs to be run as ROOT, but it is SAFE and KEEPS PRIVACY.
# The pathname information on your system is completely filtered out 
# from the final output. This program ONLY READ and DOES NOT WRITE any
# files EXCEPT "output_file*" 
#
# Parameters:
#		 dev 			:the device of the directory to be measured
#		 mount_dir	 	:the the mount point of the device
#		 test_path 		:the relative path of the directory under mount_dir
#		 output_file	:where the result is stored.
#
# Example: fragment_collect /dev/hda7 /home ningning /tmp/home-ningning.frag
#
#	This gives the fragmentation information (saved in "/tmp/home-ningning.frag")
#   of the file system objects under the directory of "/home/ningning" on the 
#   disk partition of "/dev/hda7" mounted to "/home".
