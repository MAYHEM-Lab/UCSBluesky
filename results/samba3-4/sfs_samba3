#
# The default SFS options are implied if no values are assigned to
# the variables. The variables and their meaning are as follows.
#
# The following parameters are configurable within the SFS run and
# reporting rules.
#
#  LOAD		- array of numbers specifying the NFS loads
#		  (NFS calls per second) to be generated by all clients
#		  combined. The number of consecutive runs equals the size
#		  of the array and the peak load equals the largest value
#		  in the array. (DEFAULT = 60)
#  PROCS	- number of SFS sub-processes to generate NFS
#		  calls (DEFAULT PROCS = 4).
#  MNT_POINTS	- string containing the shares of CIFS-mounted
#		  filesystems on the client which will be used in the test or
#		  it can be set to the name of a file containing a list of
#		  shares. The file should be located in WORK_DIR. The
#		  file should have the following format:
#			client1	\\svr\share ... \\svr\share
#			...
#			clientN	\\svr\share ... \\svr\share
#
#  IPV6_ENABLE	- If set ("on") then use IP V6 otherwise use IP V4.
#		  (DEFAULT IPV6_ENABLE = "off").
#  FS_PROTOCOL	- File server protocol used "cifs" or "nfs"
#		  (DEFAULT FS_PROTOCOL = "nfs")
#  NUM_RUNS	- number indicating the number of multi-client runs. NUM_RUNS
#		  should only be used if the size of the LOAD array <= 1;
#  INCR_LOAD	- number indicating the load increment factor in NFS call/sec.
#		  The first run generates LOAD calls/sec,
#		  subsequent runs are made with LOAD + (N * INCR_LOAD)
#		  calls/sec; where initial N = 0. INCR_LOAD should
#		  only be used if the size of the LOAD array <= 1.
#  CLIENTS	- string containing client's host names; include the Prime-
#		  Client's host name if you will be using the Prime-Client to
#		  generate NFS loads.
#  SFS_DIR	- string containing the directory path where the SFS
#		  executables are stored; should be the same for all systems
#		  This location is used first, if the binaries are not found
#		  there then it looks in the "binaries" directory.
#		  (DEFAULT SFS_DIR = "bin")
#  SUFFIX	- Suffix for the log files.
#  WORK_DIR	- string containing directory path where the SFS output
#		  files are stored, this should be the same for all systems.
#  PRIME_MON_SCRIPT - string containing the name of a script used to
#		  control the start and stop of any external SFS processes
#		  like external performance monitors. The sample script
#		  'sfs_ext_mon' shows the expected semantics of the program.
#		  This variable must refer to an executable on a Windows
#		  client.
#  PRIME_MON_ARGS - string containing optional arguments that are passed
#		  to the PRIME_MON_SCRIPT.
#
#  USERNAME	- The user name for mapping the share.
#  PASSEORD	- The password for mapping the share.
#  DOMAIN	- The domain for mapping the share
#  SFS_NFS_USER_ID - User ID for NFS server. Used only when running on 
#		     Windows client.
#  SFS_NFS_GROUP_ID - Group ID for NFS server. Used only when running on 
#		      Windows client.
#
# The following parameters are strictly defined within the SFS
# run and reporting rules and may not be changed.
#
#  RUNTIME	- number of seconds to generate load
#		  (DEFAULT RUNTIME = 300).
#  TCP		- If set ("on") then use NFS/TCP behaviour rather than UDP.
#  WARMUP_TIME	- number of seconds to warmup
#		  (DEFAULT WARMUP_TIME = 300).
#  ACCESS_PCNT	- percent of total file set available for use by i/o
#		  operations that will be accessed.
#		  (DEFAULT ACCESS_PCNT = 20).
#  APPEND_PCNT	- percent of writes that append rather than overwrite
#		  (DEFAULT APPEND_PCNT = 70).
#  BLOCK_SIZE	- number of KB in a block, up to 4 Meg.
#		  (Value is automatically negoitated with the server)
#  DIR_COUNT	- number of files per directory to use for directory
#		  operations (DEFAULT DIR_COUNT = 30).
#  FILE_COUNT	- number of files to use for read and write
#		  operations. By default, number of files is
#		  calculated from the specified LOAD and ACCESS_PCNT.
#  SYMLINK_COUNT - number of symbolic links to use for symlink
#		  operations (DEFAULT SYMLINK_COUNT = 20).
#
# The following parameters are useful for debugging or general system
# tuning.  They may not be used during during a reportable SFS run.
#
#  DUMP		- If set to a non-zero value, dump raw data points at end of
#		  run. (DEFAULT DUMP = 0 ).
#  LAT_GRAPH    - Debug option to enable latency graph logs. May invalidate
#                 results due to overhead of logging. (default "", to
#                 enable set to "on"
#  POPULATE	- If set ("on") then only populate the file set but do not
#		  run the test.
#  PRIME_SLEEP	- number of seconds Prime-Client should sleep after starting
#		  and stopping the SFS external monitoring facility and
#		  before sending synchronization message to clients. This is a
#		  provision to allow sufficient time for starting and stopping
#		  other performance monitoring utilities that could be used
#		  during SFS execution.
#  PRIME_TIMEOUT - number of seconds Prime-Client should wait for a
#		  response from all the clients.  Zero indicates the
#		  default should be used.
#  INIT_TIMEOUT - number of seconds Prime-Client should wait for a
#		  response from all the clients during the INIT phase.
#		  May be changed if needed and will not invalidate the
#		  run.
