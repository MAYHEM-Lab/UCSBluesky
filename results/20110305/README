Tests to evaluate the importance of various BlueSky features, so
different features are turned off for the benchmark runs.

20110305-west-fullsegments-4G
Test to S3-US-West, 4 GB disk cache, but all fetches from S3 are full
segments instead of byte ranges, and the complete segments are stored to
the disk cache.  So there are multiple effects: first, for a random
workload there is more garbage data taking up cache space; second,
fetches from S3 take longer which increases read latencies.
