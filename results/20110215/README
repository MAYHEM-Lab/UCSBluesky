These runs are similar to the later 20110226/ runs, but using the older
disk (80 GB and slower) in the proxy.

One major difference is that all OPS targets use the same working set
size for the files, rather than having it scale up with the load.  Total
there is ~10 GB of data, but the working set is around 3.0-3.5 GB.
