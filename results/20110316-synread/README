Synthetic read-only workloads.

A 32 GB filesystem is created in BlueSky, consisting of 2048 16-MB
files.  Client processes sent a number of concurrent read requests to
read random blocks from the files of sizes 32 kB, 128 kB, or 1 MB.  The
proxy's cache is set to be 0 through 48 GB in size.  Before starting,
the clients read data from all files to pre-populate the cache.

Data files are named like "32k-c16.data"--the first value is the size of
the read requests, and the second is the effective number of clients.
    c1=a single client with a single request stream
    c16=two clients, each sending up to eight requests in parallel
    c32=4 clients, 8 requests each
    c64=8 clients, 8 requests each

Columns in order are:
    cache size (GB) -- 0 corresponds to a very small (~64 MB) cache
    ops/sec
    bandwidth (MB/s)
    latency (ms)
